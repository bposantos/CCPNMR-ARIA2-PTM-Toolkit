#N-terminal and C-terminal Modifications (CCPN Analysis/Aria2.3)

#Authors: Santos, B.P.O; Silva, B.M.; de Magalhães, M.T.Q.LBM, UFMG, Brazil.

#How it was based? Aria2.3 gives the option of changing CTER to CTN in its topology file.
#However, this C-terminal addition does not communicate with CCPN project, because they don’t have the amidation atoms in their residues.
#To overcome this, we added the Nh3 molecule in the CCPN project, and created a new residue in ARIA/CNS files, correcting the angles and torsions, so now, 
#both programs can interact and perform the structure calculation.

#Installation

LINUX

Copy this directory to where the aria file (.xml) is located.

1) In the shell, type:

chmod 755 install
sudo ./install
chmod +x ../run_patches

2) Observe that, depending where the CCPN or ARIA are installed, the paths need to be changed. Here, we assume they are installed in /usr/local/ 


#Method

Setting up CCPN Analysis project:

1. In the CCPN project, go to > molecule and add at the beggining of your sequence the Acy or/and at the end of your sequence the Nh3 (don’t worry, in the sequence, stays Nh2);


2. Setting up ARIA2.3 project, in Molecule:
Linkage definition> topallhdg5.3.pep
Parameter Definition > parallhdg5.3.pro
Topology Definition > topallhdg5.3.pro


After set up your Aria file, a .xml format file, type the command:
        >tcsh
        >aria2 -s <your_aria_file.xml>
        >./run_patches <name_of_the_structure_calculation_folder> <N or C or NC>

#Ex1: run_patches folder01 N (will generate N-terminal acetylated peptides)
#Ex2: run_patches folder01 C (will generate C-terminal amidated peptides)
#Ex3: run_patches folder01 NC (will generate N-terminal acetylated and C-terminal amidated peptides)

Those files will be changed:
topallhdg5.3.pep
parallhdg5.3.pro
topallhdg5.3.pro

	> aria2 <your_aria_file.xml>
Start of the structure calculation
